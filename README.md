# Random-Forest-Classifier-to-predict-type-of-cancer-observed-in-patient
- Random Forest classification modeling was used to predict type of cancer (Malign / Banign) observed in patient
- Best Hyperparameters were found out using GridSearchCV and n_estimators (no. of Decision Trees in Random Forest) were found out using OOB (Out Of Bag) Error Rate.
- Classification Modelling Performance metrices like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score were used to evaluate the model's performance.
